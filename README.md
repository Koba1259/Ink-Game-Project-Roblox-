# InkGame Cheater Alert System

I'm a 16-year-old player with a real idea to help the Roblox community.

This tool is meant to let players:
- Report cheaters by username
- Alert other users if a reported cheater is in their lobby
- Sync these reports with a shared online list

I can't code much yet (just starting out), but I have the full vision.
I’m looking for kind developers who can help me make it real — no money involved, just community passion.

If you want to help, please open an issue or submit a PR.
